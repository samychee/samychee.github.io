    <p class="bio-text">
    From the time I was a little kid, I had a passion for drawing. From early elementary school, I began learning graphite, pastel, and watercolor and later studied painting in middle school, with studio art teacher Xinsheng Wang. It was there where I fell in love with acrylic and oil painting, and it quickly became my most favorite and strongest mediums. In high school, my technical skills and aesthetic further developed, as I joined my high school's strong art program. Since then, I have won many awards in art, including Gold and Silver Keys in the Regional Scholastic Art and Writing Awards, 1st place Houston Young Artist competition, Finalist in the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo School Art Contest, State qualifier in Visual Arts Scholastic Contest, and more.
    </p>
    <p class="bio-text">
    Along with art, I have other interests in the fine arts field. I played the piano and danced ballet and Chinese folk dance for approximately eight years, also winning awards in those areas. Since my sophomore year of high school I have taken computer science classes, learning the Java language and logical problem solving.

    <p class="bio-text">
    I have been a member of the National Art Honor Society at my high school for the past four years, and have accumulated many hours of volunteer service in the arts, such as face-painting at elementary schools, assisting at the Bayou City Art Festival, and designing and painting murals for my school’s homecoming dance, International Festival, and Retrospective art show. During the summer of 2015, I volunteered teaching little kid’s art at a daycare in China. I have also planned and extended a non-profit organization, Music Doing Good, to the Sugar Land area, providing volunteer and scholarship opportunities to fellow musicians in my city.
