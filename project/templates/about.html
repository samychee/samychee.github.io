    From the time Gina Chee was a little kid, she had a passion for drawing. From early elementary school, she began learning graphite, pastel, and watercolor and later studied painting in middle school, with studio art teacher Xinsheng Wang. It was there where she fell in love with acrylic and oil painting, and it quickly became her most favorite and strongest mediums. In high school, Gina's technical skills and aesthetic further developed, as she joined her high school's strong art program. Since then, she has won many awards in art, including Gold and Silver Keys in the Regional Scholastic Art and Writing Awards, 1st place Houston Young Artist competition, Finalist in the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo School Art Contest, State qualifier in Visual Arts Scholastic Contest, and more.
