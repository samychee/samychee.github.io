    "BIO1":"From the time Gina Chee was a little kid, she had a passion for drawing. From early elementary school, she began learning graphite, pastel, and watercolor and later studied painting in middle school, with studio art teacher Xinsheng Wang. It was there where she fell in love with acrylic and oil painting, and it quickly became her most favorite and strongest mediums. In high school, Gina's technical skills and aesthetic further developed, as she joined her high school's strong art program. Her art creativity and personal style is heavily influenced by many different facet of her life experience.
